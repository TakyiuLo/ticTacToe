Ajax etc.
- These are techniques that I used.
  - Techs:
    - HTML: The basic layout for view
    - CSS: Styling the html such as animation, color, position etc.
    - SASS: A "better" CSS. It's a framework.
    - Javascript: The magical logics happens here.
    - JQuery: Using it for its magical query selection
    - Ajax: This is where I request a response to server
    - CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete; These are for Single Page Application

    - Git: Command line tools
    - GitHub: To host the page
    - Atom: A web developer IDE
    - curl-scripts: a command line tool for requests
    - grunt: for deployment
    - NodeJS: (UNKOWN) behind scenes
